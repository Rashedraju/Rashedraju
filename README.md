# Hello devs 👋

## Rashed's Github Profile 😎

I am a frontend developer and I mostly use React in my side projects. You can check out some of my projects and if you got any questions you can reach out in the links below. 

## What programming languages I like
As a frontend developer most of my time I write JavaScript. But in my free time I am trying to build some projects in the backend as well. And when it comes to backend I like to organize my code. Because of that I like PHP as well.
